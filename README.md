What is Among Us?
Among Us[c] is an online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American[4] game studio InnerSloth and released on June 15, 2018. The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors.[d]
The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostorsâ€™ goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate at any time. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed whereas Imposters win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if critical sabotage goes unresolved
